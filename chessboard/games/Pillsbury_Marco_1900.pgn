{Queen's Gambit Declined, 25 moves. One of the great attacking games of all time. Pillsbury, a great player from St. Louis, obtains a strong center and uses it as a basis for a merciless attack on the king.}
1. d4 {Controlling the center.}
1... d5
2. c4 {The queen's gambit. If Black plays 2... dxc4 White will eventually win back the pawn.}
2... e6 {The classical way to decline the gambit.}
3. Nc3 {Developing and putting pressure on d5.}
3... Nf6 {Developing and defending d5.}
4. Bg5 {Pinning the knight and putting more pressure on d5. Pillsbury was the first to demonstrate this is the best move.}
4... Be7 {Breaking the pin.}
5. e3
5... 0-0 {Getting the king out of the center.}
6. Nf3 
6... b6 {The bishop will be developed on b7.}
7. Bd3 {White's pieces are actively placed.}
7... Bb7
8. cxd5 {White must not delay this move or Black will play dxc4 and his bishop will be very active. The recommended move now is 8... Nxd5 followed by 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. Nxd5 exd5. Black avoids 10... Bxd5 because of 11. e4 and White would control the center.}
8... exd5
9. Ne5 {Knights placed in center squares are very powerful.}
9...Nbd7
10. f4 {This provides strong support for the knight and opens the way for a kingside attack.}
10... c5 {It is correct to try to undermine the powerful knight by attacking its defenders.}
11. 0-0
11... c4? {A strategic error: Black relieves the tension in the center. Black's queenside attack is no match for White's kingside attack."}
12. Bc2
12. a6 {Preparing for b5.}
13. Qf3 {Bringing the queen into the attack.}
13... b5

15. f5 {To exchange pawns and open the file for the rook on f1.}
15... b4 {Black counterattacks on the queenside.}
16. fxg6 $1 {If 16... bxc3 then 17. Bxf6 Nxf6 18. Rxf6 fxg6 (Not 18... Bxf6 19. Qxh7#) 19. Bxg6 $1 hxg6 20. Rxg6#. If instead 16... fxg6 then 17. Qe6+ Kh8 18. Nxd7 Nxd7 (If 18... Qxd7 then 19. Bxf6+ wins the queen) 19. Bxe7 wins a piece.}
16... hxg6 {If now 17. Ne2 then 17... Ne4 and Black has counterplay.}
17. Qh4 $1 {White keeps the pressure on.}
17... bxc3
18. Nxd7 {If 18... Nxd7 then 19. Bxe7 forking the queen and rook.}
18...Qxd7 {Hoping for 19. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Qxf6 cxb2}
19. Rxf6 $1 {Wonderful move. If 19... Bxf6 then 20. Bxf6 cxb2 21. Qh8#.}
19...a5 {Black will bring his rook to a6 to help with the defense.}
