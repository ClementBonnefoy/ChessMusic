{Sicilian Defense, 17 moves. This was the 8th game of a match won by Morphy between these two great players. Anderssen was too aggressive in the opening and was soundly defeated by a brilliant combination.}
1. e4 {A move leading more often to tactical rather than positional play. }
1... c5 {The Sicilian Defense. }
2. d4 {Morphy preferred this move order to 2. Nf3 and 3. d4}
2... cxd4 {Otherwise White has control of the center.}
3. Nf3 {Black can protect the pawn with 3... e5 since 4. Nxe5 would lose the knight to 4... Qa5+. However, White gets definite compensation after 4. c3 dxc3 5. Nxc3. Morphy's opponents rarely cared to risk this line.}
3... Nc6
4. Nxd4
4... e6 {Because this move can give Black a backwards d pawn, it was condemned by the analysts for a long time. Only in the middle of the 20th century was it realized that Black's piece activity provides reasonable compensation for the backwards pawn.}
5. Nb5 {Threatening 6. Nd6+ Bxd6 7. Qxd6 with an advantage.}
5... d6
6. Bf4 {Attacking the pawn again.}
6... e5 {Now the d pawn is backwards: it will have trouble advancing to d5.}
7. Be3
7... f5 {A premature move.}
8. N1c3 $1 {White calmly develops and refutes Black's last move. There is no way for Black to stop the knight from going to d5 where it can then give a fatal check on c7. If 8... Be6 then 9. exf5 Bxf5 10. Nd5. Or if 8... a6 then 9. Nd5 axb5 10. Bb6 Qd7 11. Nc7+ and 12. Nxa8. If 8... Nf6 then 9. Bg5 a6 10. Bxf6 gxf6 11. Qh5+ is good for White. }
8... f4
9. Nd5
9... fxe3
10. Nbc7+
10... Kf7 {White could now play 11. Nxa8 exf2+ 12. Kxf2 Qh4+ 13. g3 Qxe4 14. Bg2 with an advantage in material.}
11. Qf3+ {Instead White prefers a line with incredible complications. Morphy loved to take risks, and was leading in the match 5.5 to 1.5 (draws count .5).}
11... Nf6
12. Bc4 {Threatening 13. Nxf6 checking with the bishop. Black appears to have no defense}
12... Nd4 $1 {A clever resource, attacking the queen and the pawn on c2.}
13. Nxf6+ {If now 13... Ke7 14. Nfd5+ Kd7 15. Qf7+ and 16. Nxa8 wins easily.}
13... d5 $1
14. Bxd5+ {Here Black should play 14... Ke7 leading to an extremely complicated position after either 15. Ng8+ or 15. Qh5.}
14... Kg6? {This loses at once to a fine combination.}
15. Qh5+
15... Kxf6 {White cannot play 16. Ne8+ because of 16... Qxe8 17. Qxe8 Bb4+ 18. c3 Rxe8. After the obvious attacking move 16. Qf7+ Black plays 16... Kg5 and it is not easy to get at the Black king.}
16. fxe3 $1 {Now the rook on h1 can come into the game. If 16... Qxc7 17. Rf1+ Ke7 18. Rf7+ Kd6 19. Rxc7.}
16... Nxc2+
17. Ke2 {and Black resigned. If 17... Nxa1 then 18. Ne8+ Ke7 19. Qf7#. If 17... Qxc7 then 18. Rhf1+ Kd7 19. Rf7+ Kd8 20. Rxc7 Kxc7 21. Rc1}
1-0
