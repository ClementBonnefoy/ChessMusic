{Queen's Gambit Declined, 42 moves. Karpov demonstrates his excellent technique. On move four Karpov embarks on a plan to weaken Black's queenside; after 35 moves the plan bears fruit and a queenside pawn is won. Karpov was world champion from 1975-1985.}

23... Nc8 {White's pieces are much more coordinated than Black's.}
24. b4 {If White can trade this pawn for Black's pawn on a4 and then trade his a pawn for Black's pawn on b7, Black will be left with a weak pawn on c6. This is the plan initiated on move four of the game!}

28. Ng3
28... g6
29. Rbc1
29... h5 {Black is beginning a kingside counterattack. In retrospect, it would have been better to simplify the position with 29... Nef5 since the kingside attack never materializes and the h pawn becomes a target.}

40... Qxc6
41. Rxc6
41... Ra8
42. Bd3 {and Black resigned. There is no way to prevent the threat of 43. Bxf5 and 44. Nxh4 winning a second pawn. If 42... Ra1+ 43. Kh2 Ra2 then White simply plays 44. Rc2 and the pawn on h4 cannot be saved}
