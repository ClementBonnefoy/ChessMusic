{Giuoco Piano, 42 moves. Tarkatover wins a pawn early in the game but underestimates Euwe's counterattack. Euwe sacrifices both knights and both rooks during the attack. Euwe was world champion from 1935-1937.}
1. e4 {A move that typically leads to more tactical possibilities than the positional 1. d4.}
1... e5
2. Nf3 {Developing the knight and attacking the pawn.}
2... Nc6 {Developing and protecting the pawn.}
3. Bc4 {The bishop is more aggressively placed on c4 than on b5. However, 3. Bb5 leads to longer-lasting pressure.}
3... Bc5 {Also good is 3... Nf6.}
4. c3 {Planning to play 5. d4. At one time 4. d3 was common leading to a quiet position. That is why the opening is called the Giuoco Piano which means quiet game. Black can now play 4... Nf6 5. d4 exd4 5. cxd4 Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Nxe4 7. 0-0 with a complicated position.}
4... Bb6 {With this move, Black is able to keep the position closed.}
5. d4 {Occupying the center. Black should not now play 5... d6 because after 6. dxe5 Nxe5 7. Nxe5 dxe5 8. Bxf7+ Black cannot play Kxf7 because of Qxd8. If 6... dxe5 then 7. Qxd8+ Kxd8 8. Bxf7.}
5... Qe7 {This would be a poor move in an open postion; here it is effective. }
6. 0-0 {White does not worry about 6... exd4 7. cxd4 Qxe4 because of 8. Re1 pinning and winning the queen.}
6... d6 {Black intends to maintain his pawn on e5. If Black were to play 6... exd4 then after 6. cxd4 White's center would be overwhelming.}
7. h3 {To prevent Bg5 putting indirect pressure on d4.}
7... Nf6
8. Re1 {Protecting the pawn.}
8... 0-0 9. Na3 {The knight is going to c4 where it will put pressure on Black's e pawn or to d5 via c2 and e3. Black cannot now play 9... exd4 10. cxd4 Nxe4 because 11. Ng5 wins the pinned knight on e4.}
9... Nd8 {To unblock the c pawn so that c6 can be used, if needed, to prevent Nd5. In an open position it would be suicidal to neglect development and move already-developed pieces. In a closed position, both sides can afford positional maneuvering.}
10. Bf1
10... Ne8 {This allows Black to play f6 in response to 11. Nc4.}
11. Nc4 {Attacking the pawn on e5. If 11... exd4 12. cxd4 White's pawn center would cause Black serious trouble.}
