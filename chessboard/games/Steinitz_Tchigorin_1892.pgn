1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bb5 Nf6
4. d3 {This solid variation was a favorite of
Steinitz.}
4... d6
5. c3 {Guards his d4 against a knight invasion
prepares for d4 if convenient and secures a retreat
for the king bishop at c2 so that Black can not
exchange it for his queen knight or queen bishop.}
5... g6 {The fianchetto of the king bishop is a sound
procedure. Also good was 5...a6 (to be able to drive
the bishop away with b5 when desirable.) 6. Ba4 Be7
followed by 0-0.}
6. Nbd2 {A quite satisfactory developement for the
knight which is why it does not matter that it is
deprived of c3. There is nothing wrong with the
temporary blocking of the queen bishop for the Lopez
is a positional opening in which events develop
slowly. But 6. Bg5 or 6. 0-0 followed by 7. Bg5 is
also good.}
6...Bg7
7. Nf1 {To maneuver the knight to e3 putting pressure
on Black's d5 and f5. This procedure was originated
by Steinitz in one of the games of his match with
Blackburne in 1876. Later it became standard in many
variations of the Lopez. Also very good was first 0-0
and then Re1 followed by Nf1. But Steinitz was fond
of delaying castling when such a strategy was
playable In this way he kept open the option of 
castling on the queenside.}
7... 0-0
8. Ba4 {There is a good point to this seeming waste of
time. White plans to respond with Qe2 if Black should
play d5 guarding his king pawn and preventing the
exchange of queens. If Black should then play Bd7
White wants to have a retreat for his king bishop at
c2 so that Black cannot force its exchange with
Nd4.}
8... Nd7 {This would be a good move if Black planned
to follow it up with Nb6 and d5 advancing in the
center. However Black played it with the idea of
continuing in this way; Nc5 Ne6 (The knight will be
loose on c5 after Black plays d5.) Ne7 and finally
d5. An awfully slow plan! Black had two good
alternatives; 8...a6 followed by b5 and d5 (or Na5 
followed by c5 putting pressure on Whites d4 if White
plays Bb3 instead of of Bc2 and 8...d5 at once. 
Indeed there is a certain logic to the latter move; 
White has lost a tempo with 8. Ba4 so Black can 
afford to lose one by moving his queen pawn twice.}
9. Ne3 Nc5?
10. Bc2 Ne6
11. h4 {Starting an attack against Black's king. 
White plans to play h5 and hxg6 opening his rook
file. By playing this move White has definitely
committed himself to queenside castling for his
kingside will be too exposed for him to castle
there.}
11... Ne7
(11...h6 12. h5 g5 13. Nf5 )
(11... f5 12. exf5 gxf5 13. d4 $1 exd4 14. Nxf5 dxc3 
15. Nxg7 {eliminating
black's most important defensive piece.} 15...cxb2 
16. Bxb2 Nxg7 {and the exposed position of Black's
king especially his vulnerable dark squares mean a
lost game.})
12. h5 d5
13. hxg6 fxg6? {Much better was 13...hxg6
after which Black's game might still be tenable. The
text move it is true opens Black's king bishop
file but he can make little use of it while there is
now a terrible weakness along Black's g8-a2 diagonal.
The way in which White takes advantage of this
weakness is most instructive.}
14. exd5 $1 {Surprising at first glance for White
eliminates his strong center pawn and is left with a
backward pawn on d3.}
14... Nxd5
15. Nxd5 {The next step in White's plan.}
15... Qxd5
16. Bb3 {Now we can see the point of White's last
two moves. this bishop bears down on Black's weak
diagonal.}
16... Qc6
17. Qe2 {Developing the queen and clearing the first
rank for queenside castling.}
17... Bd7 {Developing the bishop.}
18. Be3 {White plans to get in d4 after he castles
which will get rid of his backward queen pawn and
give him access to the a1-h8 diagonal in addition to
the one he already possesses.}
18... Kh8 {Getting off the bishop's diagonal.}
19. 0-0-0 Rae8 {Developing the rook on the same file
as White's queen.}
20. Qf1 {It is necessary to remove the queen from the
indirect threat of Black's rook. At the same time
this move prepares a brilliant combination. 
Precisely because this move is so necessary it had
the psychological advantage of not arousing black's
suspicion.}
20... a5 {Black hopes to start a counter attack with
a4 and a3. If he had seen what was coming he
probably would have avoided it with 20...Rf5 or Nf4.}
21. d4 exd4 {Forced if 21...e4? 22. d5 followed by
23. dxe6 attacking black's bishop.}
22. Nxd4 Bxd4 
( 22...Nxd4 23. Rxh7+ Kxh7 24.
Qh1+ {forces mate.})
( 22...Qa6 23. Bc4 Qa8 {takes Black's queen out of
the game. })
( 22...Qe4 23. Bc2 Qg4 (23...Qe5 
24. Bxg6) 24. f3 Qg3 25. Nf5 gxf5 26. Rxd7
{with a crushing position.})
23. Rxd4 $1 {A surprising move and the move that
follows is still more suprising!}
23... Nxd4
24. Rxh7+ $3 {Leading to a swift and very colorful
conclusion.}
24... Kxh7
25. Qh1+ Kg7
26. Bh6+ Kf6 (26...Kh8 27. Bxf8+ {and mate the
next move.})
