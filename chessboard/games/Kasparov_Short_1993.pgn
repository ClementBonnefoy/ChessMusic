{Ruy Lopez, 36 Moves. The seventh game in the 1993 World Championship Match. A tense struggle comes to an end when Short grabs a pawn and pays dearly for it. Kasparov has been world champion since 1985.}
1. e4 {Controlling the center and preparing to develop the bishop on f1.}
1... e5
2. Nf3 {Developing a piece and attacking the pawn on e5.}
2. Nc6 {Developing and protecting the pawn.}
3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez. The defender of the pawn is attacked.}
3... a6 {This gives Black the freedom to play b5 when needed. White cannot now win a pawn with 4. Bxc6 d7xc6 5. Nxe5 because of 5... Qd4 attacking the knight and e pawn.}
4. Ba4
4... Nf6 {Attacking the pawn on e4.}
5. 0-0 {5... Nxe5 is a playable move, but Black should not strive to hold on to the pawn. After 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 Black should play 7... d5 giving back the pawn rather than 7... exd4 which is refuted by 8. Re1. }
5... Be7 {With the e file blocked, Nxe4 is now a threat.}
6. Re1 {Guards the pawn. Now White threatens to win a pawn with 7. Bxc6 d7xc6 8. Nxe5.}
6... b5
7. Bb3
7... 0-0 {More usual is 7... d6. Black is planning to play the Marshall gambit if White plays 8. c3. The main variation is: 8. c3 d5 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. Rxe5 c6 and Black has continuing pressure for the pawn.}
8. a4 {White prefers to keep the initiative on his side. The threat is 9. axb5 and Black cannot play 9... axb5 becaue of 10. Rxa8.}
8... Bb7 {Protecting the rook.}
9. d3
9... d6
10. Nbd2
10... Nd7 {The knight is moving to c5.}
11. c3 {Supporting the center and providing an escape hole for the bishop.}
11... Nc5 {Attacking the pawn on d3.}
12. axb5 {If 12... Nxb3 then 13. Qxb3 axb5 14. Rxa8 Bxa8 15. Qxb5 winning a pawn.}
12... axb5
13. Rxa8
13... Bxa8
14. Bc2 {Although the bishop looks passive, WhIte will play b4 to chase away the knight and then return the bishop to b3. White is threatening d4 giving him a strong center.}

15. b4
15... Ne6
16. Nf1 {The knight is headed for d5 or f5 via e3.}
16... Bb7
17. Ne3
17... g6 {Black does not want the knight on f5!}
18. Bb3 {The bishop is active again.}
18... Bg7
19. h4 {White plans to weaken Black's kingside by trading off kingside pawns. This move would be weak if Black could open up the center with pawn exchanges, but he cannot.}
19... Bc8
20. h5 {White hopes to remove Black's protective shield of pawns. If Black plays 20... gxh5 then White could continue with 21. g3 threatening 22. Nh4 23. Qxh5, 24. Nf5 26. Kg2 and 27. Rh1 Black would have counterplay and the position would be very complicated.}
20... Kh8
21. Nd5
21... g5 {Although this avoids exchanging pawns, it leaves Black with weak squares, especially f5.}
22. Ne3 {White wastes no time moving his knight to f5.}
22... Nf4 {Attacking the pawn on h5.}
23. g3 {White is not phased by the attack on the pawn.}
23... Nxh5
24. Nf5
24... Bxf5 {The knight was too threatening to leave on f5.}
25. exf5 {If Black tries to protect the pawn on g5 with 25... h6 then 26. Nxg5 hxg5 27. Qxh5ch}
25... Qd7
26. Bxg5 {If Black answers with 26... Qxf5 then 27 Bd5 is very strong. The knight on c6 would be forced to move out of play and White would have an unstoppable attack against the Black king after 28. Kg2 and 29. Rh1.}
26... h6 {Either 27... Bf6 or 27... Nf6 may have been better.}
27. Nh4 {If 27... hxg5 then 28. Qxh5+ Kg8 29. Qxg5 winning easily.}27... Nf6

34... Kg7
35. Nxh6 $1 {If 35... Nxh6 then 36. Qg5+ Kh7 37. Bc2 threatening 38. f6ch. If 37... f6 then 38. Qg6+ Kh8 Qxh6ch. If 37... Bf6 then 38. Qxf6 Re8 39. Re6 Ng8 (not 39... fxe6 40. fxe6+ Kg8 41. fxd7) 40. Qh4+ Kg7 41. f6+ Kf8 42. Rxe8+ Qxe8 (If 42... Kxe8 43. Qh8) 43. Qh8 Qe1+ 44. Kg2 Qd2 45. Qg7+ Ke8 46. Qxg8ch.}
35... Bf6
36. Bxf7 {and Black resigned. If 36... Rxf7 then 37. Qg6+ Kf8 38. Qxg8#. If 36... Nxh6 then 37. Qg6+ Kh8 38. Qxh6#}
