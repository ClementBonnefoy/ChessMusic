{King's Gambit, 23 moves. In one of the most remarkable games ever, Andersson sacrifices a bishop, then two rooks, and finally his queen.}
1. e4 {This often leads to open games with tactical possibilities.}
1... e5 2. f4 {The King's Gambit. White sacrifices a pawn for control of the center square d4 and the possibility of his King's rook becoming active on the f file.}
2... exf4 3. Bc4 {This variation is called the Bishop's Gambit. White should not play 3. d4 because then 3... Qh4+ is good for Black since White would have to play 4. Ke2. A common move for White is 3. Nf3.}
3... Qh4+ {This looks threatening but actually is not the best move. Better are 3... d5 giving back the pawn and 3... Nf6.}
4. Kf1 {The king is more securely placed here than it appears, and White can gain an important tempo by attacking the Black queen with Nf3.}
4... b5 {A counter sacrifice to gain time and development. This move is not looked upon favorably nowadays.}
5. Bxb5 Nf6 {Developing and attacking the pawn on e4.}
6. Nf3 Qh6 {The queen would have been better placed on h5, but Black plans to move his knight to h5.}
7. d3 {Guarding the pawn and opening lines for the bishop.}
7... Nh5 {Threatening 8... Ng3+ 9. hxg3 Qxh1+.}
8. Nh4 {Stopping the threat and preparing to put the knight on f5 where it will be powerfully placed.}
8... Qg5 9. Nf5 c6 {If now 10. Ba4 then 10... d5 gives Black a satisfactory game.}
10. Rg1 $3 {A splendid piece sacrifice.}
10... cxb5 11. g4 {Black cannot play 11... fxg3 en passant because of 12. Bxg5.}
11... Nf6 12. h4 Qg6 13. h5 Qg5
14. Qf3 {Threatening 15. Bxf4 trapping the queen. The bottled up position of the Black queen is amusing.}
14... Ng8 {To save the queen.}
15. Bxf4 Qf6 16. Nc3 {White now has an enormous lead in development, definitely worth more than a piece.}
16... Bc5 17. Nd5 {The beginning of an extraordinary run of brilliant sacrifices.}
17... Qxb2 {Threatening 18... Qxa1+.}
18. Bd6 $3 {If now 18... Qxa1+ then 19. Ke2 Bxg1 20. e5 $3 reaches the same position as in the game.}
18... Bxg1 19. e5 $3 {Cutting the queen off from the defense of the kingside. White now threatens 20. Nxg7+ Kd8 21.Bc7#.}
19... Qxa1+ 20. Ke2 {White still threatens 21. Nxg7+ Kd8 22. Bc7#. If 20... f6 then 21. Nxg7+ Kf7 22. Nxf6 Kxg7 23. Ne8+ Kh6 24. Qf4#. Black's best may be 20... Ba6 but White still maintains a winning advantage after 21. Nc7+ Kd8 22. Nxa6 (Threatening 23. Bc7+ Ke8 24. Ne6+ Ke7 25. Qxf7#) 22... Bb6 23. Qxa8 Qc3 24. Qxb8+ Qc8 25. Qxc8+ Kxc8 26. Bf8 h6 27. Nd6+ Kd8 28. Nxf7+ Ke8 29. Nxh8.}
20... Na6 {To prevent 21. Nxg7+ Kd8 22. Bc7#}
21. Nxg7+ Kd8 22. Qf6+ $1 {Forcing the knight to remove its protection from e7.}
22... Nxf6 23. Be7#
1-0
