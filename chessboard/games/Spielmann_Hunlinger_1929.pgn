{Caro-Kann Defense, 28 moves. Spielmann increases the pressure until Hunlinger, in a precarious position, moves a piece away from his kingside. Spielmann then launches a decisive attack culminating in a queen sacrifice forcing checkmate.}
1. e4 {An opening that often leads to attacking rather than postional games.}
1... c6 {The Caro-Kann defense. It is somewhat passive but difficult to break through.}
2. d4 {Controlling the center with pawns.}
2... d5 {Contesting the center.}
3. Nc3 {Developing a piece and protecting the pawn on e4.}
3... dxe4 {Eliminating part of White's pawn center.}
4. Nxe4 {Recapturing.}
4... Nf6 {Developing and attacking the knight on e4.}
5. Ng3 {More usual is Nxf6.}
5... e6 {Opening lines for the bishop on f8. 5... h5 may have been better.}
6. Nf3 {A natural developing move.}
6... c5 {Planning to exchange White's remainnig center pawn. Perhaps it would have been more prudent to make a developing move.}
7. Bd3 {The best place for the bishop. 7. Be2 would be passive and 7. Bb5+ 7... Bd7 would lead to nothing. If Black tries 7... cxd4 8. Nxd4 Qxd4 then 9. Bb5+ wins the queen.}
7... Nc6 {Developing the knight and attacking the pawn on d4.}
8. dxc5 {Notice that the placement of White's bishop prevents a queen exchange.}
8... Bxc5 {Recapturing and developing the bishop at the same time.}
9. a3 {Preparing for an eventual b4 followd by Bb2 while preventing Nb4.}
9... 0-0 {Getting the king out of the center and bringing the rook into play.}
10. 0-0 {Following suit.}
10... b6 {To develop the bishop on b7.}

13... Na5 {There is an old saying that a knight on the rim is dim. But where else can the knight go?}
14. Ne5 {A knight posted in the center is a very powerful piece. Bishops work best at a distance.}
14... Bb7
15. Ng4 {Threatening 16. Nxf6 Bxf6 17. Bxf6 gxf6 weakening Black's king position. If 15... Nxg4 then after 16. Qxg4 Black must weaken the king position with 16... g6.}
15... Qd8 {Protecting the knight to avoid doubled pawns.}
16. Ne3 {If now 16... Qc7 then 17. Nh5 Qd8 18. Nxg7 Kxg7 19. Qg4+ Kh8 20. Qh4 Kg8 21. Bxf6 Bxf6 22. Qxh7#.}
16... Nd5? {A mistake. The knight is needed on the kingside to defend the king.}

18. Ng4 {Now if 18... gxh5 then 19. Nh6# $1}
18... Bf6 {The best defense but it is not good enough.}

22... Ne8
23. Nf5 {If Black plays 23... gxf5 then 24 Bxf5 (threatening Qxh7#) 24... f6 25 Bxe6 + Kh8 26 Bxc8 wins. If 23... exf5 then 24 Rxe7.}
23... Qc5
24. Re5 {White already has a plan to maneuver the rook to h8.}
24... Bd5
25. Ne7+ $1 {The begining of a mating combination.}
