{Queen's Gambit Declined, 34 moves. Alekhine plays a solid defense with Black and gradually improves his position until he obtains a winning advantage -- he exploits it brilliantly. This is the kind of game that makes chess look easy. Alekhine was world champion from 1937-1946.}

13. Ba2 {From here the bishop can move to b1 supporting the queen in the attack on the king.}
13... c5
14. Rd1 {Putting pressure on the soon-to-be opened d file. However, it is usually not a good idea to move a piece twice in the opening and neglect the development of other pieces.}

15... Qb6
16. Bb1
16... Bb7 $1 {It looks as if White could now play 17. Ndxb5 axb5 18. Rxd7 Nxd7 19. Qh7+ Kf8 20. Qh8#. However, Black would answer 17. Ndxb5 with 17... Qc6 18. Nd4 Qxg2 with a very good game.}

21... g6
22. Qe2
22... Nc4 {Threatening 23... Nxa6 24. bxa6 Rxc3. Black's pieces are beautifully placed. The bishop on b7 is very powerful, as is the rook on c8. The knight on c4 puts tremendous pressure on White's position.}
22. Be4 {So that if 22... Nxa3 then 23. Qf3 Bxe4 24. Nxe4 Bxd4 25. Rxd4 and White is threatening both 24. bxa3 as well as 24. Nf6+ forking the king and rook.}
